# Todo Application

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup**: The application is built using Kotlin. It uses AndroidX libraries, Room for local database management, Retrofit for API calls, and Jetpack Compose for UI.

2. **Data Management**: The application fetches data from a remote API and stores it in a local database using a repository pattern. If data is already present in the database, it returns the existing data.

3. **UI**: The application displays the data in a list format. It also includes a loading indicator and a "No data" message for appropriate scenarios. A search feature is also implemented.

4. **ViewModel**: The application uses a ViewModel to interact with the repository. The ViewModel exposes the data and a loading state as StateFlows, which the UI observes and reacts to.

5. **Testing**: The application includes unit tests for the repository to ensure the correct behavior of the data fetching function in different scenarios.
